# Challenge 1
Hi My name is Hayward Wong and this is my repository for challenge 1

## Summary
This weekâ€™s challenge is an individual coding challenge on the theme of data wrangling. I made code lines from ```DS_starter.R``` more efficient using ```dplyr``` package and ```ggplot2```to create my own version of it named ```Curlew.R```, which looked into trends of observed Eurasian Curlew population in the U.K. from the  Living Planet Index (LPI).
In addition to ```Curlew.R``` which is an improved version of ```DS_starter.R```, I also created ```Goose.R``` which looked into Goose populations in the U.K. While wrangling the data, I realised there was only 1 Curlew observation id in the UK that is longer than 15 years, and I think it is a wasted oppurtunity to plot only one site on the map. Therefore I decided to add more species and sites, this time working on 4 goose species from two different genus.
It is also important to note that Stavros is providing feedback for this challenge, Thankyou Stavros.

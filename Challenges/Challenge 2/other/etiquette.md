# Etiquette 

This file contains expected repository organisation and coding etiquette information. The following guidelines should be followed at all times when coding in this repo.
This file also contains basic rules about the style in which group 4 would like people to interact with this repository.


## Coding  Etiquette in Rstudio:

- Data, scripts and figures/image outputs should be stored in seperate folders
- Include informative comments throughout code scripts, using the hashtag (#) symbol- this improves the reproducibilty of your code for others 
- Appropriatly space lines of code to make it easier to read (leaving adequate spaces between each workflow and between lines of code)
- Section your scirpt by typing - four times (----) in RStudio next to a comment or by using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + R 
  (this adds the #comment to an outline, making it easy to find each section)
- Give informative names to all of your objects and figure that you produce
- Save figures and image outputs in a designated file with an appropriate name, use numbers to mark which plot was created first
- Keep your code to under 80-100 characters in length per line (add guidance line as reference)
- When naming column titles in a dataframe, stick to use  _ between words and do not use capital letters
- When naming files, use - for spaces and avoid capital letters
- When naming folders, avoid multiple words (use - for spaces if necessary)



## Repository Etiquette:
- the README.md file provides information about the repository- for challenges,  a intructions.md contains the challenge requirements initially set by teaching staff
- use seperate folders for data, scripts and figure/image outputs to improve repository organisation


## Licence file
The licence file lets other people know what they are allowed to do with our code code (copy it, modify it, redistribute it etc.), which is especially important for a public 
repository on GitHub which could be accessed by anyone.

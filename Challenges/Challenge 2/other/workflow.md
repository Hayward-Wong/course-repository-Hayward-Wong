# Challenge 2: workflow

Step 1: find the data set (done 27/10)

Step 2: upload the data set to R (done 27/10)

Step 3: format the data to long format

Step 4: refine the crime data set to present annual crime count per bourough between 2012-2017 (5 years)

Step 5: refine the homelessness data set to present annual homelessness count per borough between 2012-2017 (5 years) 

Step 6: produce a figure to show both data sets- as a comparison of crime rates in boroughs with different numbers of homless people (as a proxy for poverty)

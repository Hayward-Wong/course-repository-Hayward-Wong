# Load Living Planet Data
load("data/LPI_species.Rdata")

# Choose your species from this list - don't forget to register your species
# on the issue for the challenge and check that no other student has chosen 
# the species already. Every student must choose a different species!

# Check species in the data
unique(LPI_species$Common.Name)

# Filter your species here

Goose <-  LPI_species %>%

## Analysis of Variance on related variables ------------------------------------

anova(lm(logpop ~ year, 
         data = scalegoose)) # F = 2.4236

anova(lm(logpop ~ biome, 
         data = scalegoose)) # F = 74.895

anova(lm(logpop ~ Location.of.population, 
         data =scalegoose)) # F = 130.42
# The difference in abundance is significant across year, biome and location.

# scaling the year variable so it starts at 1

AICc(goose_bm1, goose_bm2, goose_bm3, goose_m1, goose_m2, goose_mm) #goose_m2 is selected as it has the lowest AICc despite having highest df

# Null model with 1 as fixed effects year and biome

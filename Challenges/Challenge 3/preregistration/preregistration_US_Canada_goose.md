1. What is the data source?  Do you have permission to use the data?

>I accessed the data from the Living Planet, which is open access to public. The paritcular datasets I am using are from Rusch, D. H., R. E. Malecki, et al. (1995) "Canada Geese in North America" and Hupp, J., R. Stehn, et al. (1995). "Arctic Nesting Geese: Alaskan Populations". 

2. What is the aim of this study?

> The aim of this study is to investigate factors affecting the population change of Canada goose in the United States. 

3. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?

> **Research Question:** How does the abundance of Canada Goose in the US varies across time and biomes?

> **Hypothesis:** The overall abundance of Canada Goose in the US will differ across different biomes and increase over time. This is in line with prior knowledge where many goose populations have now become non-migratory and settled in warmer biomes due to lack of natural predator and increased resource availability. Canada goose was believed to be extinct in the 1950s due to overhunting and loss of habitat. After restoration efforts in the 1960s, the Canada goose populations were reestablished therefore the expected increase in population over time.

4. Describe the key independent and dependent variable(s).

> **Independent variable:** ```Year```, ```Biomes```

> **Dependent variable:** Abundance of Canada goose in the US

5. What are the spatial and temporal structures to the data (number of sites, duration in years, etc.)?

> A total of 11 sites in the US and spans from 1970-1993. 

6. What is the overall sample size?

> There is 234 observations of 39183100 individuals

7. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.

> I will use a mix-effect (```Year``` & ```Biome```) linear model to explain variations in Canada Goose populations

8. Is there any other study information you would like to pre-register?
 
> I am only including sites that are stated as the ```United States``` on the Country list, exluding data from Canada, Rocky Mountains, Pacific airway, Canada/US etc. as I am focusing on the populations in the US only. Although part of those observations might have been conducted in the US, it is impossible to seperate and keep it strictly US only so I am excluding them.

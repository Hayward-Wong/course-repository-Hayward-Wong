### PART II: OCEANIA LPI DATA ----

# Libraries
# We'll need some extra functions from `tidyverse` package for initial data wrangling, but we will then come back to `dplyr`!
library(tidyr)
library(readr)

# Load the LPI dataset
marine <- read.csv("data/LPI_marine.csv")  # you can also use `readr::read_csv()` - much faster for large files

# Now let's tidy the data a little
marine2 <- marine %>%
  # change to long format with `tidyr::gather()`
  gather(key = year, value = pop, c(25:69)) %>%
  # get rid of X's for year with `readr::parse_number()`
  mutate(year = parse_number(as.character(year)),
         # define `pop` to be numeric, missing data/character entries will become NAs
         pop = as.numeric(pop)) %>%
  # drop all missing values
  drop_na(pop)

# Ignore the warning message on NAs, that's because we kept only numeric values for `pop`

glimpse(marine2)  # have a look at the dataset
View(marine2)  # you can also scroll through the table

# 3. Manipulating variables ----
# a) Extracting variables ----

marine2 %>%
  pull(Species) %>%
  glimpse()  # returns a vector of values

marine2 %>%
  select(Species) %>%
  glimpse()  # returns a new table with one column

# Select only columns you need, in the order you want
marine2 %>%
  select(id, pop, year, Country.list) %>%
  glimpse()

# Rename columns using the format `new_name = previous_name`
marine2 %>%
  select("Country list" = Country.list,  # you can use names than include spaces or other symbols that can create errors by putting them in `""`
         method = Sampling.method) %>%
  glimpse()

# Use `everything()` to return all unselected columns
marine2 %>%
  select(id, year, pop, everything()) %>%
  glimpse()  # notice that `id`, `year` & `pop` went to the front but the rest is unchanged

# Add ranges of columns with `star_col:end_col`
marine2 %>%
  select(Family:Species, 24:26) %>%
  glimpse()

# Delete columns with `-`
marine2 %>%
  select(-c(2:22, 24)) %>%
  glimpse()

# Call a vector of column names with `!!`
marine_cols <- c("Genus", "Species", "year", "pop", "id")

marine2 %>%
  select(!!marine_cols) %>%
  glimpse()

# Choose columns with names starting with "Decimal"
marine2 %>%
  select(starts_with("Decimal")) %>%
  glimpse()

marine2 %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  glimpse()  # numeric data types only selected (here: integer or double)

marine2 %>% select(id,  # put id first
                   Class:Family,  # add columns between `Class` and `Family`
                   genus = Genus,  # rename `Genus` to lowercase
                   starts_with("Decimal"),  # add columns starting with "Decimal"
                   everything(),  # add all the other columns
                   -c(6:9, system:Data.transformed)) %>%  # delete columns in these ranges
  glimpse()
# OK, maybe it wasn't the most effective way of reaching the end state here but it proves the point of large flexibility!

# Save a new object `marine3` that we'll keep
marine3 <- marine2 %>%
  select(id, Class, Genus, Species, year, pop,
         location = Location.of.population,
         lat = Decimal.Latitude,
         lon = Decimal.Longitude) %>%
  glimpse()

# b) Renaming variables ----

# Renaming to lowercase
marine3 %>%
  rename(class = Class,
         genus = Genus,
         species = Species) %>%  # renames only chosen columns
  glimpse()

marine3 %>%
  rename_with(tolower) %>%
  glimpse()
# If you didn't want all of them renamed, you could specify columns with `.cols =`

marine4 <- marine3 %>%  # let's save this one!
  select_all(tolower) %>%
  glimpse()

# Select and rename a couple of columns only
marine3 %>%
  select_at(vars(Genus, Species), tolower) %>%
  glimpse()

# c) Making new variables ----

# New column appears at the end of the table
marine5 <- marine4 %>%
  mutate(genus_species = paste(genus, species, sep = "_")) %>%
  glimpse()

marine6 <- marine5 %>%
  mutate(region = case_when(lat > 0 & lon >= 0 ~ "NE",
                            lat <= 0 & lon >= 0 ~ "SE",
                            lat > 0 & lon < 0 ~ "NW",
                            lat <= 0 & lon < 0 ~ "SW")) %>%
  glimpse()

unique(marine6$region)  # we've got populations from both sides of equator and meridian 180!

# A table of only two variables: `genus_species` and `region`
marine4 %>%
  transmute(genus_species = paste(genus, species, sep = "_"),
            region = case_when(lat > 0 & lon >= 0 ~ "NE",
                               lat <= 0 & lon >= 0 ~ "SE",
                               lat > 0 & lon < 0 ~ "NW",
                               lat <= 0 & lon < 0 ~ "SW")) %>%
  glimpse()

# Change values to lowercase
marine6 %>%
  mutate_at(vars(class, genus, location), tolower) %>%
  glimpse()  # column names stayed the same, but individual values within them are lowercase

# Adding a column (`add_column()` is from a different package - `tibble`)
library(tibble)  # load `tibble` package

marine6 %>%
  add_column(observation_num = 1:4456) %>%  # we gave each row an observation number
  glimpse()

# Summarising functions
marine6 %>%
  select(genus_species, year) %>%
  group_by(genus_species) %>%
  add_tally(name = "observations_count") %>%
  glimpse()

marine6 %>%
  select(genus_species, year) %>%
  # `add_count()` includes the grouping variable (here `genus_species`) inside the function
  add_count(genus_species, name = "observations_count") %>%
  glimpse()

# 4. Manipulating cases ----
# a) Extracting cases ----

# Here we use comparison operator `==`
marine6 %>%
  filter(class == "Mammalia") %>%
  glimpse()  # mammals only

# Match one of the specified values with `%in%`
marine6 %>%
  filter(class %in% c("Mammalia", "Aves")) %>%
  glimpse()  # mammals and aves

# Same result as above but using `|`
marine6 %>%
  filter(class == "Mammalia" | class == "Aves") %>%
  glimpse()

# Omit a category
marine6 %>%
  filter(class != "Actinopteri") %>%
  glimpse()  # all classes but Actinopteri

marine6 %>%
  filter(!class %in% c("Mammalia", "Aves")) %>%
  glimpse()  # remove classes of mammals and aves

# Filter numeric variables
marine6 %>%
  filter(pop >= 10 & pop <= 100) %>%
  glimpse()  # observations for population size between 10 and 100

marine6 %>%
  filter(between(pop, 10, 100)) %>%
  glimpse()  # same as above but more aesthetically pleasing!

# Delete NAs from `pop`
marine6 %>%
  filter(!is.na(pop)) %>%
  glimpse()  # there's already none because we deleted them earlier with `mutate()`!

marine6 %>%
  distinct() %>%
  glimpse()  # still 4456 rows so there were no duplicates!

# You can also check a number of distinct rows directly with `n_distinct()` - equivalent of length(unique(x))
marine6 %>%
  n_distinct()  # 4456 distinct rows

marine6 %>%
  select(id:species) %>%  # we'll keep less columns for clarity
  slice(2:4)  # keep only rows 2, 3 and 4! (they get new numbers though - 1, 2, 3)

marine6 %>%
  top_n(5, pop) %>%  # 5 highest population values
  glimpse()

# b) Adding cases ----

# Create a table for id == "2077"
(marine7 <- marine6 %>%
   filter(id == "2077") %>%
   select(id, genus_species, year, pop))  # we can see 27 observations for 1970-1996

# Add a row at the end
(marine7 %>%
    add_row(id = 2077, genus_species = "Chrysophrys_auratus", year = 1997, pop = 39000))

# Add a row at a specified location
(marine7 %>%
    add_row(id = 2077, genus_species = "Chrysophrys_auratus", year = 1969, pop = 39000,
            .before = 1))

# 5. Extra: Green Sea Turtle population trend ----

marine_final <- marine6 %>%
  filter(genus_species == "Chelonia_mydas") %>%
  # change `id` to factor (otherwise it would display as a continuous variable on the plot)
  mutate(id = as.factor(id))

library(ggplot2)  # you don't have to load it again if you've done it in part 2e
